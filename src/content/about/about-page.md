In November 2020 I decided to change my career from production analysis in a big international company to tech. I started to learn the basics of front-end development for 2-3 hours after my work. But I'd understood it wasn't enough. So, in February 2021 I quit my job and focused on learning. During this time I took online courses like Full JavaScript Course + React, ReactJS: Full manual, countless YouTube tutorials about HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Since March 2021, I had been studied at SoftServe IT Academy. I completed the JavaScript Fundamentals course and the React Online Marathon.
